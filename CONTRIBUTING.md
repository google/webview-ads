## Contribution Process

### 1. Issue Reports

If you've found a bug or have a suggestion for a change, please **start by opening an issue on GitHub.**
This is the primary and most encouraged way to contribute.
This allows for discussion and ensures that any potential work is agreed upon before development begins.

### 2. Code Reviews for Agreed Changes

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.
We use [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) for this purpose.

**Please do not open a pull request without a corresponding and approved issue.**
Pull requests should only be for critical fixes or changes that have been discussed and formally agreed upon by the maintainers in an issue thread.
Any unsolicited pull requests for new features or minor changes will likely be closed.
