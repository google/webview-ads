# WebView Ads API

This repository hosts the test page designed to help developers and QA teams audit their WebView implementations for Google Mobile Ads SDK integration.

## Project Overview

This web-based tool provides a straightforward way to verify that a **WebView** is correctly connected to the **Google Mobile Ads SDK**.
It's an essential utility for debugging and ensuring proper ad display within WebView environments.

## Purpose of the Test Page

The primary goal of this test page is to offer immediate visual feedback on the integration status.

**Successful Integration Indicator:**

The test page displays **green status bars** when the following critical condition is met:
